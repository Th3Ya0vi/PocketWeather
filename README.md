### The AppsAmuck Project

Want to Build Your Own iPhone Apps? Want dozens of app templates, and related graphics to help create your next app? 
We are creating over 30 new iPhone example apps that all include source code, graphics, and full tutorials.

We have created a Kickstarter project to help find people who are interested in what we are creating.
Generally the source code for one iPhone app costs $29, you can get all our apps, including source code, 
graphics, and full tutoriasl for less than that. That well over 90% off. :D

Take a look at what we have to offer, and consider supporting our project:
